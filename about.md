# About Me

-----

Hello. I am Jordan Powell, a.k.a MrDedSec. I am a Juniour Penetration Tester at KPMG UK and also freelance Cyber Security Researcher. This site contains my research and findings, which I hope you find interesting and insightful.

The main focus of my work is vulnerability disclosures, ethical hacking, threat intelligence, OSINT, and much more. I always enjoy learning about new subjects and getting hands-on experience.

I have spoken at several conferences and events, including Bsides Leeds and Newcastle.

I am also an alumnus of Leeds Beckett University and have previously served as President of Leeds Beckett University’s Ethical Hacking Society.

If you wish to contact me please contact me on my LinkedIn.

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy!
